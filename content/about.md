# Personal Life

It's interesting that you've found your way to this page, as there really isn't a lot to say about me.  I live a boring life 
in the small town of Denton, NE (current population 189), which is approximately 15 miles away from the center of the 
thriving medium-sized metropolis that is Lincoln, NE (born and raised).  I am a veteran of the United States Air Force, 
a husband, and a fur-daddy of a spoiled rotten Norwegian Elkhound named Lana.

When I'm not at work, I love spending time with my family, cheering on all Nebraska sports (Go Big Red), working on cars (ex-auto 
technician prior to my IT career), playing all types of sports (volleyball and golf currently), or just chilling at home and
being lazy.

# Professional Life

I am passionate about all things IT.  My background started in Networking/Linux in the US Air Force and very rapidly evolved into the 
management and cloud automation space.  My post-military career included several contracting/sub-contracting gigs with the DoD.  Following 
that, I spent five years as an Architect at Red Hat in this space and decided that I was interested in
seeing the next big thing, which is now Kubernetes.  I am currently fulfilling a role as a Senior Cloud Native Field Engineer 
at VMware.
